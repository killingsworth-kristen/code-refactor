# code-refactor
* This project was designed to take starter code and update it to make it more accessible for the visually impaired. Additionally, cleaning up/simplifying the CSS was part of the project requirements. The overall look of the application was not to be changed or altered.

* required elemnts include: <br>
** Making sure the font remains unchanged (size, color, type, location on the page, etc) <br>
** making sure the margins and padding between elements remains unchanged <br>
** making sure the footers appearance remains unchanged <br>

* This project was necessary to make this application accessible to all people regardless of their ability and make it easier for other developers to read and interpret the CSS code.
