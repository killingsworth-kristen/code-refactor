# code-refactor
*This project was designed to take starter code and update it to make it more accessible for the visually impaired. Additionally, cleaning up/simplifying the CSS was part of the project requirements. The overall look of the application was not to be changed or altered.

*required elemnts include:
**Making sure the font remains unchanged (size, color, type, location on the page, etc)
**making sure the margins and padding between elements remains unchanged
**making sure the footers appearance remains unchanged


*This project was necessary to make this application accessible to all people regardless of their ability and make it easier for other developers to read and interpret the CSS code. 

# Use
*At the top of the page is a navigation bar which will take you to the relevant sections of the application. Additionally, all images have alternate text which can be viewed in the browser by inspecting the elements.
